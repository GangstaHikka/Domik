# **Part**

Part is a scriptable object which represents an abstract idea of some house object.
Basically it's just the name, nothing more.
Pipeline works only with parts and knows nothing about how parts actually looks.

- **Turned 90** - link to the same part but rotated on 90 degress
- **Turned 180** - link to the same part but rotated on 180 degress
- **Turned 270** - link to the same part but rotated on 270 degress

An example above shows a Floor part. Floor has no rotation so all three rotation links are empty. 

That's how can looks a Part with rotations

## How does it works?

Let's image that we have a small room with walls, ceiling, floor, bed and some table. If we want to represent it as a room generated by Domik, we should split this room by cells.
After splitting we have 6 cells. But how we can write an info about things in these cells?
We can do it by Parts ofcouse!
Look at this screenshot:

Here we have a room

Room after splitting by Cells:

Room after splitting by Parts:

Every cell now has it's own set of Parts.
