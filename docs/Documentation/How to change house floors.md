To change house floors, you have to edit a floors list in the **Floors** panel of the [[House Generator]] component.  
This panel contains a list of [[Floor]] scriptable objects, an order of list elements is inverted,  
so, if you want to add something like a basement floor, you have to order it to the end of the list.  

<br />  

**Flex floors** are floors that can be duplicated to achieve a target size of the house, so it's better to add them in the middle of the house.  
Every floor contains an [[Interior]] list and [[Floor Tag]]s.
