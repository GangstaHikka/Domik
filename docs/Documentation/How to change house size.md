This panel defines target size of the house. Final size can be different and depends on the Pipeline.

- **Width** - target width of the house.
- **Length** - target length of the house.
- **Floors** - target floors count.

You can select between two size modes: **const** and **rand**
- **const** - constant size.
- **rand** - random size.
