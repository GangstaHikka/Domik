### Tips


There are a lots of ways to use it.

- First, you should use it if you have a PlaceableObject which can be placed in multiple places. To do it create a PlaceableObjects for every possible Place, add them to the PlaceableObjects list below and change mode to **Place First Relative** or **Place Random Relative** mode.

- Second case is then you have multiple similiar PlaceableObjects but want to add only one. To do it add them to the list and change mode to **Place Random Relative** mode.

- And the last is the case when you want to place a list of PlaceableObjects at the same time. Pretty suitable when you want to stay interiors list little bit cleaner.

>And yes, you can make something like a container with **Place All** mode and fill it by containers with  **Place Random Relative** mode, so this container will try to place all child containers.
